        "detalhes": "Moderate: Do not use alcohol or medications that contain alcohol while you are receiving treatment with codeine. This may increase nervous system side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, difficulty concentrating, and impairment in thinking and judgment. In severe cases, low blood pressure, respiratory distress, fainting, coma, or even death may occur. With certain long-acting formulations of narcotic pain medication, consumption of alcohol may also cause rapid release of the drug, resulting in high blood levels that may be potentially lethal. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions on how to take this or other medications you are prescribed. Do not use more than the recommended dose of codeine, and avoid activities requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating hazardous machinery until you know how the medication affects you. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medication without first talking to your doctor. "
